  "year": 2021,
  "venue": "FAccT",
  "description": "This paper triggered one of the most significant epistemic ruptures in AI research, mixing technical claims, ethical concerns, and political stakes. It's perfect for demonstrating adversarial reasoning, synthesis reframing, and boundary localization.",
  "abstract": "In this position paper, we focus on the specific harms that may arise from generative language models, paying particular attention to social and environmental harms. We argue that the harms we identify are direct consequences of the scale and design of these systems. We further argue that these harms are not merely speculative future risks, but present-day, concrete harms that are already being perpetuated and amplified by these systems. We conclude by calling for more careful consideration of whether and how these systems should be developed and deployed.",
